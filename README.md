# mobill.js

## Description

Using primarily JavaScript, I created a password generator that adapts to the user's needs. The password generator will display a password of the user's choice between 8 and 128 characters in length, and will include at least one character quality: lower case :abcd:, upper case :capital_abcd:, symbols :symbols: or numbers :1234: based on the user's choice.

No more reusing the same old password, this password generator will randomly generate a combination of lower case and/or upper case letters, as well as numbers and symbols should you wish to include it as part of your password criteria.

Go on and check out my [password generator](https://disantoz.github.io/mobill.js/)!
